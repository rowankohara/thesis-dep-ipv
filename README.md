# Association of Interpersonal Violence and Polygenic Risk Scores with Depressive Symptoms in College Students
*A thesis for in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Bioinformatics at Virginia Commonwealth University.*


To better understand genetic and environmental risk factors for depression symptoms, this masterâ€™s thesis will examine if exposure to pre-college IPV is associated with depression symptoms and if these associations vary by sex, perform cross-ancestry genome-wide association studies of depression symptoms in a college sample, and assess if pre-college IPV moderates the association of aggregate genetic risk (PRS) with depressive symptoms using the Spit for Science (S4S) dataset.
